        <h4>What is Mangu?</h4>
        <p>Mangú is a popular Dominican side dish that’s made with mashed plantains and can be served with meat, eggs, and cheese. See how to prepare mangú here.</p>

        <p>Creamy, rich, and delicious, mangu is one of my favorite plantain-based recipes. Not only is it very simple to make, it’s also very versatile as you can make it the main dish for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Served with quick pickled red onions, this is an easy and nutritious recipe full of potassium, vitamin c, magnesium, and many other benefits that make for a wonderful meal.</p>
