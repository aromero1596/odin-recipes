        <h4>What are croquetas?</h4>
        <p>Croquetas are small rolls made from a mixture of olive oil, butter, flour, and milk flavored with Serrano ham and deep-fried to crispy perfection.  (Although, if you’re like the locals in Spain, you might want to try more adventurous flavors, like mushroom or even chocolate!).</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Serrano Ham</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Frying Oil</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by heating the butter and oil in a heavy pan.</li>
            <li>When fully melted and hot, add the onions and sauté for about 5 minutes--until just starting to color.</li>
            <li>Next, mix in the nutmeg and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Add the diced Serrano ham and cook for no more than a minute.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and sauté, stirring constantly to cook the flour without burning it.</li>
            <li>Once the flour has browned, it's time to add the milk.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, over the next 15-20 minutes. Every time the mixture gets dry, add some more milk.</li>
            <li>Once all the milk has been added and the dough is creamy and thick, remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li> Pour the croquette dough into a large bowl, and let it cool to room temperature. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the dough, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight).</li>
            <li>When it's cool, take it out of the fridge and make little logs using spoons or a piping bag.</li>
        </ol>
